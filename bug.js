This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` component with certain configurations. Specifically, when setting `autoFocus` to `'off'` and attempting to manually focus using the `focusAsync` method, the camera might fail to focus, resulting in blurry images.  The camera preview may appear normal, but captured images are out of focus. This is particularly problematic when dealing with static scenes where auto-focus is undesirable but manual focusing is crucial.
