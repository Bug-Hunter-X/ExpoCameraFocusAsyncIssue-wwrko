While a perfect solution may depend on your specific needs, one approach involves using a library like `react-native-camera` which may offer more fine-grained control over the camera's focusing capabilities, providing a reliable alternative to Expo's `Camera` component when manual focus is essential.  Another approach might involve carefully examining the camera parameters and exploring the possibility of adjusting them using different focus modes or exposure settings, though this is very device-dependent.  Experimentation will be crucial here, and there might be no universal solution.

Example using react-native-camera (Requires installation):

```javascript
import { RNCamera } from 'react-native-camera';

// ... other code

<RNCamera ref={(ref) => { this.camera = ref; }} style={styles.preview} type='back'>
  // ...
</RNCamera>

//Focus the camera manually (e.g., after some delay):
this.camera.focusAsync({autoFocus: RNCamera.Constants.AutoFocus.off})
```

Remember to handle potential errors and adjust based on your specific integration.
